                            Many universities in the world have a registrar office, and most of them have their own variations on a common theme. 
                            At Quaid-i-Azam University, our Registrar Office is one of the central support service departments. The Registrar provides 
                            support for the academic as well as administrative purposes of the University with a range of services that is known as administration.
                            At Quaid-i-Azam University, this administration stretches from support for the recruitment, placement and development of University’s teaching
                            and administrative staff, admission of students, through record-keeping for most of the activities of current students, to award ceremonies and
                            careers advice; it also includes support for systems and processes which underpin academic administration, for the structures of academic programs,
                            and for records management within the University. This office is headed by the Registrar, who reports to the University’s Vice Chancellor.
